## Tech Stacks
* [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.8.
* [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) version 4.8.0

## Getting started
Run `npm i` to install all the dependencies. 

### Start Server
* Run `ng serve` to start the server and navigate to  `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Running Tests

#### Unit Tests
* Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests.

#### Integration Tests
* Run `cypress run` to execute integration tests.

## Next Steps

This was a really fun kata! The next steps would include making the albums clickable for more info. Upon clicking them, the app could display a model with the full cover image or navigate the user to a new page where they can learn more about the album. This would include writing more cypress level tests to verify the user is navigated to the appropriate screens.
